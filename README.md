## Greetings, I'm Nicholas. :wave:

I'm a senior technologist, educator, conference speaker, athlete, and event organizer currently living near Denver, Colorado; and working on distributed key management for blockchain networks.

### Professional Interests :briefcase:

Teaching is a passion, both as a speaker or one-on-one. Subjects of interest include reverse engineering, network security, radio transmitter hunting, public safety communications, and graphics rendering. I can trace my interest in engineering and education to the Amateur Radio study group I formed with several friends in middle school, which resulted in most of us earning our licenses, myself included. 

Today, I continue that tradition of sharing knowledge by [authoring technical blog entries](https://www.secretfader.com), working to [build communities through events][cogoldrust], and mentoring the next

## Offline :sunrise_over_mountains: :biking_man:

When offline, I enjoy a number of outdoor sports, including [riding my Catrike Dumont recumbent cycle][cycling], [running](https://www.instagram.com/p/CmEu7YjuGpx/), and hiking the beautiful Rocky Mountains with my family.

### Have a question? :mag:

My primary development environment is Visual Studio Code (with the Vim extension), usually running on my M1 Max MacBook Pro. When at the desk, I use a [Voyager keyboard from ZSA with Kailh Choc Brown switches][keyboard]. :keyboard:

Want to know how I performed a specific task or which color scheme I'm currently using? Reach out via email (available on my profile and in Git history).

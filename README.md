## Greetings, I'm Nicholas. :wave:

I'm a Senior Engineer, educator, conference speaker, and event organizer
currently living near Denver, Colorado. I work with Rust, TypeScript, Elixir,
JavaScript, GraphQL, Kubernetes, Ethereum, private blockchain frameworks, and a whole host of other tools to build reliable,
elegant software and products that users love.

### Professional Interests :briefcase:

While I enjoy writing Rust code, I'm at my happiest when helping others achieve their technical goals. I enjoy teaching, both as a speaker and one-on-one. Subjects of interest include reverse engineering, wireless security, and graphics rendering.

I can trace my interest in engineering and education to the Amateur Radio study
group I formed with several friends in middle school, which resulted in most of
us earning our licenses, myself included. Today, I continue that tradition of
sharing knowledge by [authoring technical blog
entries](https://www.secretfader.com), working to [build communities through
events][cogoldrust], and mentoring the next generation of
engineers one-on-one at local events and makerspaces.

## Offline :sunrise_over_mountains: :biking_man:

When I'm not working, I enjoy a number of outdoor sports, not the least of which is [riding my Catrike Trail recumbent tricycle][cycling], and taking hikes in the beautiful Rocky Mountains with my family.

### Have a question? :mag:

My primary development environment is [VSCodium][vscodium] with the excellent [VSCode Vim extension][vscode-vim], usually running on my [Fedora]-powered [Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon][thinkpad-x1]. :computer: When at the desk, I use a [Moonlander Mark I keyboard from ZSA with Kailh Box Brown switches][keyboard]. :keyboard:

Want to know how I performed a specific task or which color scheme I'm
currently using? Reach out via email (available on my profile and in Git history).

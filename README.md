## Greetings, I'm Nicholas. :wave:

I'm a Senior Engineer, educator, conference speaker, and event organizer
currently living in Denver, Colorado. I work with Rust, TypeScript, Elixir,
Node.js, Kubernetes, and a whole host of other tools to build reliable and
elegant software.

### Professional Interests :briefcase:

I can trace my interest in engineering and education to the Amateur Radio study
group I formed with several friends in middle school, which resulted in most of
us earning our licenses, myself included. Today, I continue that tradition of
sharing knowledge by [authoring technical blog
entries](https://www.secretfader.com), working to [build communities through
events](https://www.cogoldrust.com), and mentoring the next generation of
engineers one-on-one at a local makerspace.

### Have a question? :mag:

Want to know how I performed a specific task or which Neovim color scheme I'm
currently using? Most of my personal configuration is included in the
[`ops`](https://github.com/secretfader/ops) repository. If that doesn't answer
your inquiry, reach out via email (available on my profile and in Git history).

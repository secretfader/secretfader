## Greetings, I'm Nicholas. :wave:

I'm a Senior Engineer, educator, conference speaker, and event organizer
currently living in Denver, Colorado. I work with Rust, TypeScript, Elixir,
JavaScript, GraphQL, Kubernetes, Ethereum, private blockchain frameworks, and a whole host of other tools to build reliable and
elegant software.

### Professional Interests :briefcase:

I can trace my interest in engineering and education to the Amateur Radio study
group I formed with several friends in middle school, which resulted in most of
us earning our licenses, myself included. Today, I continue that tradition of
sharing knowledge by [authoring technical blog
entries](https://www.secretfader.com), working to [build communities through
events](https://www.cogoldrust.com), and mentoring the next generation of
engineers one-on-one at local events and makerspaces.

### Have a question? :mag:

My primary development environment is [Neovim][vim] running inside [`tmux`][tmux], usually on my [Fedora]-powered [Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon][thinkpad-x1]. :computer: When at the desk, I use a [WASD VP3 61-key mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches][keyboard]. :keyboard:

Want to know how I performed a specific task or which color scheme I'm
currently using? Most of my personal configuration is included in the
[`ops`](https://github.com/secretfader/ops) repository. If that doesn't answer
your inquiry, reach out via email (available on my profile and in Git history).
